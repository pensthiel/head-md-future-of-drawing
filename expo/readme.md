## Todo list



PICO

- [ ] Find out IR commande for on/off so that we can emulate it

Mac mini programming

- [ ] transfer protocol
- [ ] frame player to display movie
- [ ] program autostart

RPI programming

- [ ] review and clean up code
- [ ] add code for IR signal to control pico (the led has been set up)
- [ ] remove part about playing the frames (since we will do that on mac-mini)
- [ ] find out if we can control the usb power output, and on/off the usb (for the lights)
- [ ] test and tweak timings and maybe add tutorial drawing ?
- [ ] calibrate camera focus and WB/aperture/colors
- [ ] calibrate alignement of camera - projection (write a program to micro-calibrate/deform for the alignment if needed)
- [ ] test sound on the pico speakers



Questions

- [ ] will we have wifi ?
- [ ] does it preview an animation the last few frame ? maybe right after the pic was taken, while we move the object
- [ ] how will ppl understand what to do and that we should move it a frame of indications could show?
- [ ] if there's live contact between rpi and projector we could display the tutorial at certain moments on the pojection on the wall
