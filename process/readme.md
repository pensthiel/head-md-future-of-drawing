# Researche continuation and animation machine idea

## Interview
On my first interview test, my questions weren't very good but I had an insightful discussion with someone who said they don't draw much but they used to draw to make little animations, and that drawing is exciting because of the posibilities and all the things you can come up with and creat.

## On the topic of animation
Following this discussion, I remembered that I was doing silly little animations too. I then dig up an old collections of little animations I had made in that quick, low expectation and high spontaneousity and intuition flow. I realised that for me this is when drawing feels the best, when you convey a story without worring about how you draw, when it happens quick enough that you can almost create the scene in your head in real time, where it doesn't matten if it's stick figures. When it moves it comes alive.

## Ipad animation apps
In an app like "animatic" on the ipad, whereyou have a stylus to draw and the app is bare bone with very little options, it's very easy to be loose and spontaneous if your drawings, since theres a lot of frames to do you want to be very quick and since it goes by fast there is no use in focusing on the details. the less you focus on doing it "well", the more expressive and fun the result will be.
The app is easy to use, you have the most basic and nessesary tools for hand drawn animation:
Onion skin, new frame and export video.

## Resulting path I might go on
I absolutely love those ipad apps but when drawing on a tablet i loose all the sensory joy of traditional drawing tools such as the Caren d'ache products. My thought was that If i could make an app or tool that can provide tools such as Onion skin and "next frame" but phisically to use with traditional tool, I could make hand drawn or paint animation as accessible and as easy as when I use those ipad apps, we could make works as expressive as my digital exaples but with the feeling of physical tools and with the beauty, colours and textures of Caren d'ache tools.

## thoughts about the process
How could I redirect field researche that way?
- rewrite interview questions
- make animation cadavre exquis with classmates and take notes
- prototype the paper roll mechanisme of my drawing

Things that the device could be doing:
- roll paper like a "parchemin" to get to the next blank frame automatically
- Projector for onion skin?
- camera to capture frames for onion skin
- the camera could double as quality export material like if you have a light and maybe a wall to block external lights and the fact that the drawing will be directly placed correctly for "prise de vue direct" and it would make the process even more accessible if you have direct export and no post process are needed.

## Thoughts
Should probably be a small drawing area, as small drawings are quicker, less focused on details and its easier to loosen up..
small is trasportable
small you can leave on a desk and use anytime

## Goal ?
Remove all friction in the traditional animation workflow to make it more *accesible*, quicker, less scary easier to experient animating with all kind of tools.
ipad-like silly animations but with ~ sensory pleasur ~ and *texture* and ALL THE TOOLS
