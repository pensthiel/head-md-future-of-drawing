## Setting up the Rasberry PI

I plugged the PI to power and a screen but nothing appeared so I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RHuDKq7ONQ) to flash the sd card. IT WORKED:

## controlling the projector

TRY to control it with HDMI with a Python library.

plan B : 
OCTO-ISOLATORs connected to buttons to control the projector buttons with the pi, you activate it as if u were turning on a led.


Don't forget we'll add LEDs to the house !
