Doug recommended I use OpenCV to use the camera as imput instead of physical buttons.
I found [this](https://github.com/amarlearning/Finger-Detection-and-Tracking) but it's in PYTHON, I would like to do everything in python to learn it but teachers will probably recommend using Processing java...

Is Processing Python an option ?????
